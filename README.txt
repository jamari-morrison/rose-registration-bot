Instructions:

1.)Make sure chromedriver.exe and input.csv are in the same directory as the executable "theJuice.exe"
2.)Edit input.csv to have the first line be your license code and the second line be your CRNs (if done in a text editor the CRNs should be separated by commas with no spaces. If done in excel then they should just be in separate cells).
    For example:
        12345
        432,5431,54423,2313,5242
3.) Run "theJuice.exe" the official version will automatically register exactly on the launch date, but this experimental version launches 3 minutes after the script starts
4.) When the browser opens, select "register for classes", log in, select the term to register for, and enter your PIN (DON'T PRESS THE BUTTON AFTER ENTERING YOUR PIN, THE BOT DOES THAT ITSELF)
6.) This is an EXPERIMENTAL VERSION and will no longer work after sept. 1st

For testing, use the experimental lisence code "123"
